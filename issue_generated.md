**Title**: Develop Audio Transcription Feature for Meeting Recordings

**Description**: 

The task involves developing a new feature for our application that will allow users to transcribe audio from meeting recordings into text. This feature will be particularly useful for users who want to review meeting discussions without having to listen to the entire recording. 

The feature should be able to handle different audio formats (e.g., .mp3, .wav, .aac) and should be able to accurately transcribe different accents and dialects to the best extent possible. The transcriptions should be timestamped to allow users to easily locate specific sections of the meeting. 

The transcription feature should also include an option for users to download the transcriptions in a text format of their choice (e.g., .txt, .docx). 

**Acceptance Criteria**: 

1. The feature can accurately transcribe audio from meeting recordings into text.
2. The feature can handle different audio formats (e.g., .mp3, .wav, .aac).
3. The transcriptions are timestamped.
4. Users can download the transcriptions in a text format of their choice (e.g., .txt, .docx).

**Additional Notes**: 

- We may need to use a third-party API for the transcription service. Google Cloud Speech-to-Text, IBM Watson Speech to Text, and Microsoft Azure Speech Service are potential options. 
- We should consider implementing a feature that allows users to edit the transcriptions for any inaccuracies.
- The UI for this feature should be user-friendly and intuitive. 
- We need to ensure that this feature complies with all relevant privacy laws and regulations. 
- We should also consider the potential impact of this feature on the application's performance and make necessary optimizations.
