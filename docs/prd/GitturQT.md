## 1. Introduction

GitturQT is an innovative platform designed to streamline the developer workflow by automating the transition from ideas to deployment. By leveraging AI agents and integrating key development processes, GitturQT aims to become an indispensable tool for developers, reducing manual overhead and enhancing productivity.

## 2. Objectives and Goals

- **Simplify Developer Workflow:** Minimize the manual tasks developers face by automating processes from idea inception to deployment.
- **End-to-End Integration:** Provide a seamless experience where developers can input ideas, and the system handles PRD creation, task extraction, issue generation, coding, and deployment.
- **User-Centric Design:** Ensure that developers have control with review systems at each step, allowing for manual interventions when necessary.
- **Leverage AI and Pattern Recognition:** Utilize advanced AI agents and fabric patterns to interpret inputs and generate accurate outputs.

## 3. Product Overview

GitturQT is a desktop application built with Python and PyQt. It serves as a unified platform where developers can:

- Input project ideas or requirements.
- Automatically generate detailed PRDs.
- Extract tasks and prioritize them.
- Convert tasks into GitHub issues with comprehensive descriptions.
- Automate coding and deployment processes.
- Interact with AI agents for assistance and guidance.



## 4. Target Audience

- **Primary Users:** Software developers seeking to optimize their workflow.
- **Secondary Users:** Project managers and team leads looking for tools to enhance team productivity.

## 5. Key Features and Functionality

### 5.1 Idea Input and PRD Generation(Phase 1)
#Start Date : 07-10-2024
#End Date : 11-10-2024

#Pramana Vachana : Conceptual understanding of the project by implementing issues portion. By the end of this phase I should be able to create issues from phase 1 document.

#Middle Out

- **Audio Transcription:** Record meetings and convert audio to text transcripts we will be using AssemblyAI to generate the text transcripts using our hakuna matata fastapi server.
- **AI-Powered PRD Creation:** Use AI agents created by us to generate detailed PRDs from transcripts and additional documents.
- **Custom Prompts:** Allow optional custom prompts to guide PRD generation.
- **Fabric Pattern Recognition:** Implement fabric library to recognise the  patterns to identify key elements in inputs.
- **PRD Review:** Developers can review generated PRDs, provide feedback, and request changes.
- **PRD Verification:** Ensure PRDs meet project requirements and guidelines.

### 5.2 Task Management(Phase 2)

- **Task Extraction:** AI agents extract tasks from PRDs, categorize by priority or phase if not done by the AI agent it will be categorized by the developer in the QT app.
- **Task Assignment:** Assign tasks to developers with estimated time frames and priorities(Manual review to check the time frame and priority).
- **Priority Setting:** Set task priorities to manage workflow effectively(Manual review to check the priority).
- **Manual Review:** Developers can review tasks, provide feedback, and request changes.

### 5.3 GitHub Integration(Phase 3)

- **Issue Generation:** Convert selected tasks into GitHub issues with detailed descriptions, acceptance criteria, documentation links and details from the PRD.
- **Automated Coding:** Utilize AI agents to write code based on GitHub issues(Need to discuss this more in detail).
- **Manual Review** Developers can review code, provide feedback, and request changes.
- **Deployment Automation:** Once code is approved, commit the changes to the repository.

### 5.4 User Interface

- **Intuitive Design:** A clean, user-friendly interface built with PyQt.
- **Customization Options:** Allow users to customize settings and preferences.

## 6. Technical Requirements

### 6.1 Technology Stack

- **Programming Language:** Python

- **Transcription:** Automatic conversion of audio to text.
- **PRD Generation:** AI agent creates a PRD using the transcript, documents, and optional custom prompts.
- **Review:** User reviews the PRD and approves or requests changes.

### 8.3 Task Extraction and Management

- **Task Extraction:** AI agent extracts tasks from the approved PRD.
- **Review and Edit:** User reviews tasks, sets priorities, assigns developers, and sets deadlines.
- **Task Confirmation:** Finalize tasks for issue generation.

### 8.4 Issue Generation and Coding

- **GitHub Issues:** Selected tasks are converted into detailed GitHub issues.
- **Code Generation:** AI agents begin coding based on the issues.
- **Review Code:** Developers review, test, and approve code before merging.

### 8.5 Deployment
