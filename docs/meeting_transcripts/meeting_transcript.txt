**Alice:** Thanks for joining, everyone. Today, we need to tackle the issue of how our AI agents can effectively extract tasks from PRDs and categorize them by priority or phase. Let's start by discussing the inputs we’ll need for this process. Bob, can you share your thoughts?

**Bob:** Absolutely, Alice. The primary input will be the PRDs themselves. We’ll need to consider their structure, as they can vary greatly. We should gather samples of different PRDs from our past projects to understand the range of formats and terminology used.

**Carol:** That’s a good point, Bob. Besides the PRDs, we might also need historical data on task categorization. This includes previous task lists, their priorities, and phases. This could help train our AI models to recognize patterns.

**Dave:** I agree. It would also be beneficial to have some metadata about the projects. For instance, information like project timelines, deadlines, and stakeholder priorities can help in determining the context for task urgency and importance.

**Alice:** Great suggestions! So, we’re looking at PRDs, historical task data, and relevant project metadata. What other inputs might we consider?

**Bob:** We could also consider user feedback. If we can gather insights on how previous tasks were prioritized or if there were any changes in phase, that feedback could refine our model further.

**Carol:** And let’s not forget about collaboration tools. If teams use specific tools for task management, we could integrate those as well to ensure our AI agents align with current workflows.

**Alice:** Perfect! Now, moving on to expected outputs—what do we envision as the outcome of this process?

**Dave:** The primary output would be a structured list of tasks extracted from the PRDs, complete with categorization tags indicating priority levels—like high, medium, or low—and their corresponding phases—such as planning, development, or testing.

**Bob:** Additionally, I think it would be beneficial to have a confidence score associated with each task and its categorization. This way, users can gauge how reliable the AI’s extraction is.

**Carol:** Good idea! It could also help in identifying tasks that might require human review, especially if the confidence score is below a certain threshold.

**Alice:** That’s very useful. So, our outputs include a task list with categorization and confidence scores. Are there any specific requirements we should consider for implementation?

**Dave:** Yes, we’ll need a robust natural language processing (NLP) framework for parsing the PRDs. I recommend looking into libraries like SpaCy or NLTK for text extraction.

**Bob:** We also need to think about training data for our models. It would be crucial to create a labeled dataset of tasks from the PRDs to help our AI learn how to extract and categorize effectively.

**Carol:** And we should consider the deployment environment. Depending on where the AI agents will run, we may need to ensure they can handle real-time processing, especially if users need instant results.

**Alice:** Great point, Carol. We might also want to think about user interfaces. How will users interact with the AI outputs? Should there be a dashboard or integration with existing tools?

**Dave:** A dashboard would be ideal. It can display the extracted tasks, their categories, and allow users to make adjustments as needed. We could also implement feedback loops where users can confirm or refute the AI's categorization.

**Bob:** That would enhance the learning process for the AI, ensuring it improves over time based on user interactions.

**Alice:** I love where this is heading! Let’s summarize our discussion: we’ll need various inputs, including PRDs, historical task data, and metadata. The expected outputs are structured task lists with priority and phase categorizations, plus confidence scores. For implementation, we need an NLP framework, labeled datasets, and a user-friendly interface.

**Carol:** I’ll start looking into different NLP tools and see which might be the best fit for our needs.

**Bob:** I can begin collecting historical data and preparing a dataset for training.

**Dave:** I’ll focus on the confidence scoring model and how we can integrate feedback loops into our system.

**Alice:** Sounds like a solid plan! Let’s reconvene next week to check on progress. Thanks, everyone!
